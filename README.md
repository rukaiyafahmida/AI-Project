# AI-Project

In this project, we will predict whether a star is a Pulsar or not.
We have collected a data-set from internet, and modified it.
We have applied these machine learning models: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbour. 
Then, we have acquired Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Recall, Precision and F1 Score.
